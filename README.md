# Hello people!
 my name is Tiago and i live EN FRANCE, I discovered coding at the age of 16 in high school and quickly fell in love with it.
 Today, at 18, I am training to become a web and mobile developer.
 However, my ambition goes beyond web and mobile development: I am also interested in game development, design, and 3D.
